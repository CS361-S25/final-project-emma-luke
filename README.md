TODO
In order of importance/to-do
* Create proper organism and world classes (may need to create a species specific class as well, for differing competition behavior, can do this later) can likely take from base code of ae assignment
* Add to world class a "permanently destroyed" type of cell
* Add extinction and spreading likelihood attributes to each organism
* Create 50x50 grid in web.cpp and the random destruction pattern, with proper visualizations for one organism

Future to-do
* Config panel seeding and slider for values
* Add another species
* Add gradient environment
* Either save results to a CSV or plot data with tool like matplotlib or seaborn
